### Usage Information

#### Using “container-on-demand” to run MySQL:
1. Request an Ubuntu 18.04 container with Python 3.7.
2. Connect via SSH or WebTerminal.
3. Start MySQL service in the container before running any queries:
   ```bash
   $ service mysql start
   * MySQL Community Server 5.7.30 is started
